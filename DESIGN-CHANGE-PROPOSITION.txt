To address the need to differentiate between customers and staff, a new activity should be added as the first screen of the app.

On this screen would simply be two buttons, one with the text "Customer" and one with "Staff".

On pushing either button, that choice will be permanent until manually changed, with the intent of allowing staff to select the correct
option themselves when they first turn the devices on at shift start.

On selecting "Customer" the app will proceed exactly as it is now, proceeding to the menu, but the add snack button will be hidden
and unable to be interacted with.

On selecting "Staff" a login dialog will be shown, allowing a staff member to input their credentials. When they is passed, the app will
also proceed as it is now, but the add snack button will be present.
